# Discord Daily Pancakes Bot v1.0
 A Python bot that logs into Web Discord and gets daily pancakes from Pancake bot (https://pancake.gg/).
 Please note that you much change the following in the program for it to function properly.
 The bot has been adjusted to my setup by default, please note that you will have to:
 
 - Change the username and password variables in "account.py" to your discord email and password for Login
 - You must have Selenium and Chrome Webdriver installed on your computer
 - Change the Directory of the chromedriver.exe in LINE 16
 - Change the Discord Channel URL to whatever Discord Channel you prefer in LINE 18
 
That's all it takes for Setting up the program! Enjoy!
